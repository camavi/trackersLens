# Trackers Lens AI Entry Point

Purpose: minimal entrypoint for AI agents working on Trackers Lens.
Read when: always, before touching code.
Do not read when: never; this file is intentionally short.
Last updated: 2026-06-11.

## Read Order

1. Read this file.
2. Read `docs/ai/current-focus.md`.
3. Read only the module file that matches the work area.
4. Read `docs/ai/task-registry.md` only when changing task status.
5. Read archive files only when history is explicitly needed.

## Module Map

- Project state: `docs/ai/project-state.md`
- Current active work: `docs/ai/current-focus.md`
- Architecture rules: `docs/ai/architecture.md`
- File ownership map: `docs/ai/file-map.md`
- CMSwift usage: `docs/ai/cmswift-guidelines.md`
- Tasks: `docs/ai/task-registry.md`
- Decisions: `docs/ai/decisions.md`
- Flow Map overview: `docs/ai/flow-map/overview.md`
- Flow Chat agent: `docs/ai/flow-map/prompt-chat.md`
- Safe executor: `docs/ai/flow-map/safe-executor.md`
- Endpoint research: `docs/ai/flow-map/endpoint-research.md`
- Runtime graph: `docs/ai/flow-map/runtime-graph.md`
- Runtime stores/channels/dependencies: `docs/ai/runtime/`

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- Trackers Lens is a local AI Runtime Operating Environment, not a dashboard builder.
- Use existing runtime modules in `core/runtime/` before adding new systems.
- Use CMSwift for app UI: dialogs, toolbar, panels, forms, tables, tabs, inspectors and controls.
- Keep canvas, node cards, graph links and live visual layers custom only where runtime interaction requires it.
- Do not invent endpoint URLs or domain-specific data. Endpoint discovery must be attributed and confirmed.
- Mutating Flow Agent commands must go through the registered tool layer and safe executor.
- Destructive operations must be dependency-aware and must preserve user data unless explicitly confirmed.
- Update `docs/ai/current-focus.md` and `docs/ai/task-registry.md` when task state changes.

## Legacy Markdown Policy

The old large markdown files were replaced by `docs/ai/*` to reduce token load.
Do not recreate large monolithic project memory files.
