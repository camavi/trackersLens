# File Map

Purpose: locate implementation ownership quickly.
Read when: deciding which files to inspect.
Do not read when: file scope is already obvious.

## Endpoint Research

- `api/ai-embedding-proxy.php`: optional same-origin local helper for localhost embedding providers that do not return browser CORS headers.
- `api/ai-chat-proxy.php`: optional same-origin local helper for localhost chat providers that do not return browser CORS headers.

## Shared UI / App

- `node_modules/jsswift/`: UI framework package.
- `js/tl-sidebar.js`, `css/tl-sidebar.css`: standard sidebar.
- `pythonRuntime.html`, `js/pythonRuntimeView.js`, `css/pythonRuntimeView.css`: dedicated transparent management page for Core-registered Python environments, packs and models.
- `js/TlConfig.js`: store constants and app config.
- SQLite status diagnostics are read directly from the restricted TL Core preload bridge by `js/settingsView.js`.

## Electron Desktop Shell

- `package.json`: Electron scripts and development dependency.
- `electron/main.cjs`: desktop lifecycle, secure BrowserWindow, CSP, validated IPC and navigation policy.
- `electron/preload.cjs`: minimal renderer bridge; it must not expose Node.js, filesystem or unrestricted IPC.
- `core/desktop/tl-core.cjs`: Electron-independent allow-listed desktop command boundary.
- `core/desktop/desktop-persistence.cjs`: Core-owned SQLite schema and allow-listed collection operations.
- `core/runtime/node-execution-contract.js`: versioned multi-runtime manifest/request/result normalization.
- `core/runtime/python-pack-resolver.cjs`: Core-side read-only resolution of declared Python dependency packs; it never installs packages.
- `core/runtime/runtime-manager.js`: runtime registry, JavaScript execution routing and health status.
- `core/desktop/managed-python-runtime.cjs`: managed Python process adapter used by the POC and the feature-gated NLP development worker.
- `core/desktop/python-runtime-catalog.cjs`: Core-only inventory/removal adapter for declared Python packs, managed environments and registered local model directories; returns safe metadata only and never renderer-visible paths.
- `core/desktop/managed-python-pack-installer.cjs`: Core-only transactional installer for allow-listed trusted packs; creates/reuses a managed venv, installs only a declared lockfile and downloads only declared revision-pinned models after confirmation.
- `runtimes/python/tl_python_worker.py`: JSON Lines worker with POC handlers and an environment-gated local Sentence Transformers embedding handler.
- `runtimes/python/tl_python_sdk.py`: minimal capability-scoped Python node SDK.
- `core/runtime/processor-runtime.js`: owns the Flow Map `Python Test` processor bridge and its Event Bus output/error/status events.
- `test/tl-core.test.cjs`: unit tests for the desktop boundary.
- `test/electron-preload-smoke.cjs`: Electron renderer smoke test for the sandboxed preload bridge.
- `test/python-poc.test.cjs`: Python POC protocol tests.
- `test/python-nlp-pack.test.cjs`: optional offline local NLP-pack embedding integration test.
- `docs/ai/runtime/desktop-persistence.md`: SQLite-only desktop persistence contract.
