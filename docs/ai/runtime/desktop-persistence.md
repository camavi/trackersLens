# Desktop Persistence: SQLite-Only Desktop

Purpose: define the SQLite-only persistence architecture for the Trackers Lens desktop app, owned by TL Core.
Read when: changing desktop storage, SQLite, persistence bridge or repository APIs.
Do not read when: changing browser-only compatibility code.

## Decision

SQLite is the only persistent store for the Electron desktop application. TL Core is its sole owner.

The database belongs to TL Core. Electron Main supplies only the app-data path and the validated IPC adapter. Renderer code, JavaScript workers and Python workers never receive a database handle or arbitrary SQL capability.

```txt
Renderer repositories
        │ validated persistence requests
        ▼
TL Core persistence service ──► SQLite file in Electron userData
                                       │
                                       └─ schema, migrations, audit
```

Python remains computation-only. A Python node can return a proposed record or transformed payload; a TL Storage node/Core policy validates and persists it.

## Store Contract

Records remain JSON-like objects keyed by `id`. The names below are SQLite logical collections in `tl_records`; they preserve current payload envelopes while callers are moved behind Core repository APIs.

| Data class | SQLite logical collections | Desktop treatment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Workspace and assets | `tl_pages`, `tl_widgets`, `tl_connections`, `tl_settings` | Local library, Box Editor, connection and channel paths use Core SQLite. |
| Runtime graph | `tl_flows`, `tl_runtime_nodes`, `tl_runtime_dependencies`, `tl_channels` | First implementation group; Graph Store/snapshot already use the Core boundary in desktop SQLite mode. |
| Runtime observations | `tl_events`, `tl_flow_logs`, `tl_box_performance`, `tl_time_travel_snapshots` | All use the Core SQLite boundary. |
| AI state | `tl_ai_providers`, `tl_ai_agents`, `tl_ai_runtime`, `tl_ai_jobs`, `tl_ai_logs`, `tl_ai_memory`, `tl_ai_prompts`, `tl_ai_prompt_flows`, `tl_ai_metrics` | Move after runtime observations, with a separate desktop-secret policy. |
| Knowledge | `tl_knowledge_documents`, `tl_knowledge_chunks`, `tl_knowledge_embeddings`, `tl_knowledge_entities`, `tl_knowledge_relations`, `tl_knowledge_dictionary`, `tl_knowledge_events`, `tl_structured_knowledge`, `tl_knowledge_queries`, `tl_knowledge_sources`, `tl_knowledge_metrics` | Core SQLite repository group. |
| Operational state | `tl_offline_queue`, `tl_offline_cache`, `tl_packages`, `tl_package_lock`, dynamic StorageRuntime collections | StorageRuntime writes `tl_history` or normalized `tl_storage_*` collections through Core SQLite; other operational owners remain to be isolated from browser compatibility code. |

`localStorage` is not part of the first database cutover. UI preferences such as Flow Chat open state remain renderer-local until they are separately catalogued and moved through an explicit settings migration.

## SQLite Model v1

The first SQLite schema is deliberately document-oriented to preserve the existing record shapes and avoid a global relational rewrite:

```txt
tl_meta(key, value_json, updated_at)
tl_records(store_name, id, workspace_id, record_json, created_at, updated_at)
tl_migration_runs(id, source, status, manifest_json, started_at, completed_at, error_json)
tl_migration_items(run_id, store_name, record_id, payload_hash, status, error_json)
tl_backups(id, path, manifest_json, created_at)
```

Required indexes: `(store_name, id)` unique, `(store_name, workspace_id)`, `updated_at`, and migration-item lookup by `(run_id, store_name, record_id)`. `record_json` stores the unmodified logical record; canonical columns only support safe scope/query operations. Domain-specific relational tables are a later optimization and require their own migration/compatibility design.

`tl_meta` contains at minimum `schemaVersion`, `storageContractVersion`, `profileId`, and the active persistence mode. SQLite is opened with migrations and integrity checks managed by TL Core; it is not exposed through preload.

## Persistence Mode

Desktop mode is `desktop-sqlite`. It is Core-owned and never supplied by a renderer URL, worker or Python option. New desktop persistence APIs must fail clearly when unavailable.

## Product Policy

This repository is development-only. SQLite is the sole persistence authority: do not add recovery, shadow, rollback or browser-database paths. Every desktop write has one owner—TL Core SQLite—never a dual-write path.

## Current Implementation

Implemented foundation:

- `core/desktop/desktop-persistence.cjs` owns SQLite schema/integrity and allow-listed record operations through Node's built-in `node:sqlite`.
- Readiness `getStatus()` is lightweight and reports integrity as `not-checked` for an existing database. Explicit `getStatus({ verifyIntegrity: true })` runs the full integrity check; Settings diagnostics requests this mode. Repository preflights must not scan the whole database. Activation retains its mandatory integrity check.
- Electron Main supplies only the private app-data path. Preload exposes named commands and never a database path, handle or raw SQL.
- `database.html` is the read-only SQLite Explorer in Electron. It requests the allow-listed collection catalog and records through TL Core, so developers can inspect logical collections and JSON payloads without opening the database file or executing SQL from the renderer. It requires that bridge and has no demo-data fallback. Its actions are limited to selection, copy and local JSON export—never editing, deleting, duplicating or importing records.
- `database.html` loads only its UI framework, configuration, sidebar and Explorer script. It does not load graph, cache, package, editor or other persistence runtime modules.
- `TrackerLensRuntimeGraphStore`, `RuntimeSnapshotStore`, `TrackerLensEventLogStore`, `TrackerLensConnectionsStore`, `TrackerLensChannelRegistry`, `TrackerLensLocalLibrary`, `TrackerLensBoxEditorDialog`, `TrackerLensBoxPerformanceMonitor`, `TrackerLensTimeTravelStore`, `TrackerLensKnowledgeRuntime`, `StorageRuntime` and the `SQLiteRepository` workspace adapter use the Core SQLite boundary for desktop persistence. `StorageRuntime` is SQLite-only.
- No browser-oriented persistence implementation participates in desktop persistence.
- Runtime manifest permissions accept old persisted tokens and normalize them to `sqlite.read` / `sqlite.write` at load time. New palette nodes must declare the SQLite tokens directly.

## Acceptance Tests

- Core rejects unknown persistence commands, paths, store names and raw-SQL requests.
- SQLite integrity and allow-listed record reads/writes/deletions are covered by automated tests.
- A desktop Flow Map smoke test must prove that Core-owned persistence is reachable only through the restricted preload bridge.
- Every active desktop collection group has its readers and writers on SQLite; only old persisted manifest metadata is normalized during loading.

## Explicit Non-goals

- No replication, sync service, cloud backup or multi-device conflict resolution.
- No use of SQLite by Python or arbitrary package code.
- No browser-side persistence paths.
