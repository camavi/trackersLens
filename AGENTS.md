# Trackers Lens AI Entry Point

Purpose: minimal entrypoint for AI agents working on Trackers Lens.
Read when: always, before touching code.
Do not read when: never; this file is intentionally short.
Last updated: 2026-08-31.

## Read Order

1. Read this file.
2. Read `docs/ai/current-focus.md`.
3. For substantial tasks, read `docs/ai/project-state.md`.
4. Read `docs/ai/file-map.md` when deciding which implementation files to inspect.
5. Read only the module file that matches the work area.
6. Read `docs/ai/task-registry.md` only when changing task status.
7. Read archive files only when history is explicitly needed.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- Trackers Lens is a local AI Runtime Operating Environment, not a dashboard builder.
- Use existing runtime modules in `core/runtime/` before adding new systems.
- Use JSswift for app UI: dialogs, toolbar, panels, forms, tables, tabs, inspectors and controls.
- Keep canvas, node cards, graph links and live visual layers custom only where runtime interaction requires it.
- Do not invent endpoint URLs or domain-specific data. Endpoint discovery must be attributed and confirmed.
- Mutating Flow Agent commands must go through the registered tool layer and safe executor.
- Destructive operations must be dependency-aware and must preserve user data unless explicitly confirmed.
- TL is an organizer and transparent supervisor of runtime output, never a hidden semantic judge: it must not silently block, rank away, rewrite or filter producer/LLM/Python facts. Preserve representable output and its provenance; expose uncertainty through explicit, inspectable quality/attention labels. Only technically non-representable records (for example blank endpoints) may be blocked. User-configured limits remain authoritative.
- Do not hardcode Trackers Lens limits that hide, truncate, cap or partially save runtime data, prompts, tokens, chunks, debug traces, previews or exports. User-configured limits are allowed; internal safeguards must be opt-in/configurable and must never override explicit user settings or prevent full inspection.
- Update `docs/ai/current-focus.md` and `docs/ai/task-registry.md` when task state changes.

## Legacy Markdown Policy

The old large markdown files were replaced by `docs/ai/*` to reduce token load.
Do not recreate large monolithic project memory files.
